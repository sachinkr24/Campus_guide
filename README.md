About the project:

In this project, chatbot is used for providing interactive conversion between college and the particular user who wants to get the details related to college. Using Chatbot for college purposes will also help the student to get information related to important notices such as exam schedules, results, etc. The students do not have to go physically college for any enquiry purposes which will save the time as well as travelling cost. The user can get to know any information related to college just by asking questions to the chatbot and it will respond it to the user effectively.
